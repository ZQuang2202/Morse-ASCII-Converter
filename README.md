Convert a ASCII file to Morse code file is easy. The problem is convert Morse code file to ASCII file in the fastest way and required minimum of memory. This idea is the binary representation/integer of the Morse character. This is simpler and faster than look up using a string representation. Here is the binary tree of the Morse characters. The data structure that contains Morse code and its ASCII character and its binary representation is build in data.h file.
