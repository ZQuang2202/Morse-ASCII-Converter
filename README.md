Converting an ASCII file to a Morse code file is easy. The problem is to convert the Morse code file to an ASCII file in the fastest way and require a minimum of memory. The idea is to utilize the binary representation/integer of the Morse character. This is simpler and faster than lookup using a string representation. Here is the binary tree of the Morse characters. The data structure that contains Morse code and its ASCII character and its binary representation is built in [this file](https://github.com/ZQuang2202/Morse-ASCII-Converter/blob/main/data.h).
